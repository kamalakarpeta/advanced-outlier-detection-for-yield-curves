# Project: 

**Advanced Outlier Detection for Yield Curves**

# Objective:

To enhance the accuracy and reliability of yield curve construction by implementing advanced outlier detection techniques using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to identify and mitigate the impact of anomalous data points on the overall yield curve shape.

# Approach:

**Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
Collected historical yield curve data, including spot rates, forward rates, and other relevant financial metrics.
Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and gain insights.

**Feature Engineering:**
Engineered relevant features from the raw data, such as:
Yield curve slope, curvature, and convexity
Historical volatility of interest rates
Economic indicators and market sentiment
Time-based features like day of the week, month, and year

**Anomaly Detection Model Development:**
Implemented advanced anomaly detection techniques, including:

_Isolation Forest:_ Identifies outliers by isolating data points in a random tree-based structure.

_One-Class SVM:_ Learns a decision boundary to separate normal data points from outliers.

_Autoencoders:_ Reconstructs input data and flags instances with high reconstruction error as anomalies.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**
Trained the models on historical yield curve data, tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.
Evaluated the models using appropriate metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve.
Iteratively refined the models based on evaluation results and domain expertise.

**Integration with Yield Curve Construction:**
Integrated the anomaly detection models into the existing yield curve construction pipeline.
Flagged and/or corrected anomalous data points before the curve-fitting process.
Collaborated with fixed income analysts to assess the impact of outlier detection on yield curve accuracy and consistency.

# Expected Outcomes:

Improved accuracy and reliability of yield curve construction.

Reduced the impact of anomalous data points on financial analysis and risk management.

Enhanced decision-making processes for traders, portfolio managers, and risk analysts.

Increased confidence in the quality of yield curve-based products and services.

By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide a more robust and reliable solution for yield curve analysis and forecasting.
